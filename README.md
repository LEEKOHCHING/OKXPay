# 💡 Proposal: Enable Native QR Payment Protocol Support in OKX Wallet
### 🧭 Overview
Currently, **OKX Wallet** can generate QR codes that include the main chain, token type, and amount — for example:
bnb chain:0xafeb9b9df9490df5b84f52e2cd6f16a52ac9f1ee?token=0x319558c8ad708dc42f45ab70eada4750d6c942d7&amount=1000


However, the wallet **cannot currently recognize or process** this QR format when scanned.  
This means a format that is already clear, lightweight, and developer-friendly remains **underutilized**.

---

### 🚧 Problem Statement
This limitation prevents OKX Wallet from being used smoothly in **real-world crypto payment** and **POS scenarios**.  
As builders in the crypto payment space (e.g., [TabbyPOS](https://twitter.com/TabbyPOS)), we see this as a **missed opportunity** for OKX Wallet to take the lead in frictionless crypto payments.

When scanning this type of QR, users should expect the wallet to:
- Automatically detect the **main chain** (e.g., BNB Chain)  
- Identify the **token contract address**  
- Autofill the **amount** field  
- Jump directly to the **payment confirmation page**

Currently, users still have to **manually** select the network, token, and amount — which adds friction and can lead to mistakes.

---

### 🚀 Proposed Solution
1. **Add native support** for QR codes using the format  
   `chain:address?token=...&amount=...`
2. **Auto-parse and pre-fill** the following:
   - Chain (BNB, ETH, Polygon, etc.)  
   - Recipient address  
   - Token contract address  
   - Payment amount
3. **Optional UI/UX improvements**:
   - Show token logo and name automatically when recognized  
   - Multi-chain fallback if `chain:` field is not specified

---

### 🧩 Example Use Case
For merchants using **TabbyPOS** or other blockchain-based POS systems:
- The merchant displays the payment QR code (as above).  
- The customer scans it using **OKX Wallet**.  
- The wallet instantly recognizes the chain, token, and amount.  
- The user simply clicks “Confirm” — no manual setup required.  

✅ Result: **Faster payments**, **fewer errors**, and **a smoother checkout flow**.

---

### 🌍 Why This Matters
By implementing this lightweight payment protocol, OKX Wallet could:
- Lead the way in **real-world Web3 payments**.  
- Empower builders and merchants in the crypto POS ecosystem.  
- Strengthen OKX’s brand as the most **user-friendly multi-chain wallet**.  

This is a **small technical step** but a **big leap for usability** and community impact.
